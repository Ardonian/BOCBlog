##### Active Directory Domain Controllers

On the journey to becoming a red teaming legend, you will frequently hear terms like "Active Directory", "domain controller" and "look mom, I'm a domain admin!". In this post I will attempt to explain what a domain controller is... 

In most cases an organization manage identities using Active Directory

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions](http://slashdot.org)

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself](http://www.reddit.com).

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com) and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

##### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
    But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dt>Definition list</dt>
<dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

<dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
<dd>Does _not_ work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables | Are | Cool |
| --- | :---: | ---: |
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is | centered | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less | Pretty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Still | renders | nicely |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
